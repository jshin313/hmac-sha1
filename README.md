# Yet Another HMAC Implementation
An implemention of HMAC using SHA-1 I made for learning purposes

### Build and Run
```console
make
./hmac
0xb34ceac4516ff23a143e61d79dfa7a4fbe5f266
./hmac.py
0xb34ceac4516ff23a143e61d79dfa7a4fbe5f266
```

### Credits
I didn't implement sha-1 and instead used the [teeny-sha1 implementation](https://github.com/CTrabant/teeny-sha1/) for the hmac implemented in c.
